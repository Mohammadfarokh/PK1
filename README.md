# PK1: Programming Course 1 Solution

This repository contains the sample solution for the **Programming Course 1 (PK1)** practicum, offered during the 2nd semester at **Fachhochschule Dortmund**. The course focuses on strengthening programming skills in Java and covers essential concepts such as:

- **Procedural Programming**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Control Structures**
- **Data Structures**
- **Algorithms**

## Overview

This solution implements all tasks and assignments required for the PK1 course. It provides clean, well-documented code and serves as a comprehensive reference for students who are learning Java fundamentals. The project showcases how to apply these core programming concepts to solve typical programming problems, with an emphasis on clear and maintainable code.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Procedural Programming**: Understanding and applying basic procedural techniques for problem-solving.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementing classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Control Structures**: Utilizing conditionals (`if/else`), loops (`for`, `while`), and `switch` statements.
- **Data Structures**: Using arrays, lists, stacks, queues, and other essential data structures to manage and manipulate data.
- **Algorithms**: Implementing and optimizing algorithms for problem-solving, including sorting, searching, and other computational methods.

## Purpose

This repository is designed as a **learning resource** for students of the PK1 course. It provides a clear and structured approach to mastering Java fundamentals and applying them in practical programming scenarios.
